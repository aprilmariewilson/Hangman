Hangman Game

Play this movie/TV inspired version of Hangman. There are three different categories and multiple titles in each category. If you get stuck at any time just click  the hint button below the keyboard to get a hint. Guess the title but for your hangman is drawn on the television screen and you win! If the hangman is drawn before you figure out the title, it is game over for you.




This is a simple front end game using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript. There is also a little JQuery and a fun little animation. This app is media responsive. Click the icons in the header to take you to my Github repository or my LinkedIn profile.
